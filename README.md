# Currency_Converter
This Python program is a command-line currency converter that uses an online API to get real-time exchange rates. It sends a request to the ExchangeRate-API to fetch the latest rates for a selected source currency. The program checks for errors such as invalid currency codes, network issues, or negative amounts.
